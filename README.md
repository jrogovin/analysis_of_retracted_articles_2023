# Analysis of Retracted Articles in 2023
The goal of this project is to expand on the work done by Van Noorden (2023). This article argues that retraction rates in 2023 are on the rise, citing a large number of retractions from the publisher, Hindawi, and breaks down retraction by country. The specific goals of this project are to take Van Noorden's work further by analyzing retraction by publisher, year, retraction reason, author, country, and time from original publication to retraction notice. In addition I propose several hypotheses:
  1. Overall Retraction Rates: Retraction rates have increased in 2023 from previous years.
  2. Reason for Retraction: The main reason for retraction is scientific misconduct and retractions due to scientific misconduct have increased in 2023 from previous years.
  3. Retraction Notice: Proper retraction notices have increased in 2023 compared to previous years (at a higher rate than the increase to retraction overall), however there are still not retraction notices for each retracted article in the dataset. 
  4. Author Group Size: Previous studies (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11192-021-04125-4) have shown that the larger the group of authors, the lower the rate of retraction. I will study team size and retraction rate by year. My hypothesis is that team size versus retraction rate has stayed consistent over time and that the larger the team size, the lower the retraction rate.
